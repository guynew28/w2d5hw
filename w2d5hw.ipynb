    "Your assignment for today is to create a parking garage class to get more familiar with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). This project would usually be a pair programming project. However, for the size our class we will have groups of 2-3. This means, that one person(The driver) will code the project while the other people(The navigators)will brainstorm and guide to a working solution.\n",
    "Each of you should share/switch these roles every 30mins-1hr (-- Or you may elect to switch \"drivers\" after creating specific methods of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Initial Driver needs to Make sure to:\n",
    "create a local folder for the project, create a github repository, commit the inital files, share the link\n",

    "\n",
    "Both navigators should then:\n",

    "Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- takeTicket\n",
    "- This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",
    "- This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
    "- payForParking\n",
    "- Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
    "- If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
    "- This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
    "-leaveGarage\n",
    "- If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
    "- If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment\n",
    "- Once paid, display message \"Thank you, have a nice day!\"\n",
    "- Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)\n",
    "- Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)\n",
    "\n",
